# Heap
### by Antonio Garosi - July 2018

Heap is a kid-targeted interactive game aimed at promoting cooperation, fast-thinking and consequentiality.
Ideally, it's a [Tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram) meets [Jenga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga) meets [Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(game)) game (this salad is also heavily seasoned with [Beasts of Balance](https://beastsofbalance.com/)'s sauce).

The game was initially conceived to be themed about ecological issues, and the questions are accordingly based on reports about italian waste production.
Expanding the game to other subjects is just a matter of choosing new pairings of questions and answers, coding them and updating the game firmware.

As of October 2018, the most tested version of the game is based of the following rules:

* The players have at their disposal a pool of blocks and tiles.
* Blocks of different materials represents different waste byproducts: natural wood for paper, blue acrylic for plastics, white and red PLA for generic waste. Each block also represents a quantity expressed by its size. Each cube it is made of represents 10kg.
* Each tile is numbered and represents a question.
* The players start a question by placing a card over the central base of the game. Each question is about quantity and they can replied by placing the blocks over the tile.
* If the amount and type of blocks placed over the tile properly answers its question the players can keep building the heap by adding tiles and blocks and so on.
* If the players the players place the wrong amount or type of blocks, the base shakes and the heap crumbles.
* If the players don't reply quick enough, the base shakes and the heap crumbles.
* If the players inadvertently remove or make fall blocks from the heap, the base shakes and ...yep, the heap crumbles.
* If the heap crumbles down, the game is lost.

Full explanation and production details of the project can be found in the [original documentation](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablabsiena/students/antonio-garosi/final-project/), realized as a final project for my Fab Academy course in 2018.
