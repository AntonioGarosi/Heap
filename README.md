# Heap
### by Antonio Garosi - July 2018

Heap is a kid-targeted interactive game about waste production, aimed at promoting cooperation, fast-thinking and consequentiality.
Ideally, it's a game where [Tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram) meets [Jenga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga) meets [Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(game)).
The rules are by design loose, customizable and open.

_**Update October 2018**_
__I'm upgrading and updating several parts of this project in these week. This makeover will also affect the game rules which will be soon posted as a new game mode__

Full explanation and production details of the project can be found in the [original documentation](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablabsiena/students/antonio-garosi/final-project/), realized as a final project for my Fab Academy course in 2018.
